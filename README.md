# Sample Code(Coming Soon...)

This sample code will send the randomly generated PoGG report data to Arkreen Network.

## Prepare the environment

```
git clone git@github.com:arkreen/ApiMinerPushDoc.git
cd ApiMinerPushDoc/sample
npm install

```

## Config the API Miner

* Using any text editor to open `miner.js` file
* Change the `minerAddress` variable to your miner address
* Change the `minerPrivateKey` variable to your miner private key


## Run the API Miner

```
node app.js
```

When the application is running firstly, the miner has not made any PoGG report, the application will report the first PoGG data with `1` green generation sample, after that, the application will report PoGG data to Arkreen Network every hour with `12` green generation sample.
